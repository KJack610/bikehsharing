Overview of Statistical Analysis
The purpose of the analysis  is to help investors determine if they should invest in a bike-sharing program in Des Moines
Results:
a. Checkout Times for Users: The highest number of users checkout for five minutes. At five minutes, the number starts to decrease. As the checkout period increases, the number of users decreases.
b. Checkout Times by Gender: Men use the bikesharing service significantly more than women. Even at the peak (5 minutes), 33,326 women are using the bike and 108,087 men are using the bikes. In both men and women, after the five minute mark (icnreases in checkout times) are associated with less users.
c.Trips Weekday Each HOur: The highest numbers of users occur from 8-9 am period and 5-7pm period. The days with the highest users are Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. 
d. Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour_) Men use the ride sharing (still more than women) on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thurdays from the 8-9 time period, and 5-7 pm period. On Wednedsdays, the majority of men are using the service from the 8-9 am time period. This trend is consistent in women as well but with less female users.
e. Trips by Gender by Usertype per Weekday: Similar to the previous visualizations, the majority of subscribers are men and use the service the most on Monday, Tuesday, Thursdays and Fridays. This trend is also observed in men. Males that are customers and very similar to the women customers. The usage is about the same. Customers, both male and females use the the services mostly on Saturdays. 

Summary:
Based on the results, men are the highest users (almost 3X more than women.) The start times were consistent in both and women which include weekdays: Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays from the 8-9 am frame and 5-7 time frame. This is consistent with the times that people are usually heading to work and leaving work respectively.  
Shorter times (5 minutes) see the highest users. 

Based on the analysis
a. 1st analysis: I would look at a map and which areas have the most users determine which areas have the highest number of users and determine the variables that contribute to the differences.
B. 2nd analysis: I would investigate the effect of women's age on the trends that you are seeing. I would want to know if the age of women are impacting the imbalance between men and women. If women have children, they might be less likely to ride in the mornings and evenings because of parental obligations. I would also see where they are clusters of women using the service to dtermine how the location/ users per location is impacting women using the bikesharing service.
